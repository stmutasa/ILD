vol = the full, unadulterated input volume
box = Reconstructed volume from the boxes used for prediction only
FullOverlay = 4 channel RGBA overlays of the full volume strided prediction values
Overlay = 4 channel RGBA overlays of the half volume strided prediction values
mask = the binary threshold mask used on each volume
preds = Volume of only the half strided prediction boxes with values = softmax of class 1
preds = Volume of only the full strided prediction boxes with values = softmax of class 1
